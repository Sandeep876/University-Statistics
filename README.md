# University-Statistics

Cluster the United States into regions of states which are geographically and culturally similar to each other. 
Determine whether there is a significant difference in the average ranking of the universities within each of these regions. 
If such a difference does exist, investigate which specific attributes of a region correlate with a difference in university rankings.

Average University Tuition and Average Income
Although there seems to be a positive correlation between average university tuition and average income, the correlation coefficient is not high enough to be conclusive

Ratio of Public and Private Universities and Average Income
As we can see from the figure beside, we could find no correlation between ratio of public and private universities and average income of the regions.

we can see that the cities which have a greater number of companies have a greater number of universities around them.From the graph, we can say that the top ranked universities are private universities with low acceptance rate.
Going on from the left to right we can say that the acceptance rate is being increased for both private and public universities. 
From the graph, we are obtaining the information about the private universities has more tuition fee when compared to pubic universities irrespective of ranking of the university.
we can conclude that universities with higher tuition fee does not affect the financial aid.public universities have high enrollment irrespective of ranking,
whereas the private universities have lesser enrollment.
public universities have high enrollment irrespective of ranking, whereas the private universities have lesser enrollment.

If region and university ranking are truly independent of each other, then we should be able to treat each region’s group of universities as a random sample of the total population of universities.
From each of these clusters, we constructed a 90% confidence interval regarding the population mean (112.864).
If region and ranking are independent, we would expect this value to fall within the confidence interval for each region’s rankings.
This value actually falls outside of the confidence intervals for the New England, Mid-Atlantic, and Rocky Mountain regions.
Although the correlation coefficient of -0.55 was concerning, it is a bit ambiguous.
There could be a significant correlation there, or could not.
To investigate this further, we made another plot; this time, rather than grouping by region, we plotted each individual university’s rank on its state’s income level.


Conclusion

Different regions of the U.S. do have different average rankings of universities. In other words, some regions have, on average, better schools than others. 
It seems that a region's population density and the quality of its high schools are values that vary with the average university ranking of the region.
